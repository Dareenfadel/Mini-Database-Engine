# Java Database Project with Paging and Octree Index

## Introduction

This Java database project incorporates paging and an octree index to enhance data storage and retrieval efficiency.

## Features

- **Paging**: Efficient organization of data into fixed-size blocks for improved storage and retrieval.
- **Octree Index**: Multidimensional index structure for optimized data indexing and retrieval.

## Usage

This project offers the following functionalities:

- **Inserting Data**: You can insert data with or without using the octree index.
- **Deleting Data**: Data deletion is supported both with and without the octree index.
- **Updating Data**: Update operations are available.
- **Searching Data**: Efficient data retrieval using the octree index and standard search methods.

## Performance

This project is designed to provide superior performance for data operations due to the integration of both paging and the octree index. Detailed performance benchmarks and analysis can be found in the project's documentation.
